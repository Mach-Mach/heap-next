A new machine-learning algorithm that listens to digital heartbeat data could
help veterinarians diagnose murmurs and early-stage heart disease in dogs.
Developed by a team of researchers from the University of Cambridge, the study
analyzes electronic stethoscope recordings to grade murmur intensity and
diagnose the stage of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD)—the most common
form of heart…
