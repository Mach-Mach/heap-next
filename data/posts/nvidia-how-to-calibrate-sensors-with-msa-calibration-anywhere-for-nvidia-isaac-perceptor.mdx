Multimodal sensor calibration is critical for achieving sensor fusion for
robotics, autonomous vehicles, mapping, and other perception-driven
applications. Traditional calibration methods, which rely on structured
environments with checkerboards or targets, are complex, expensive, time-
consuming, and don’t scale. An automatic sensor calibration solution that
simplifies the calibration…
