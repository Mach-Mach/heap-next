Quantum dynamics describe how objects obeying the laws of quantum mechanics
interact with their surroundings, ultimately enabling predictions about how
matter behaves. Accurate quantum dynamics simulations inform the development
of new materials, solar cells, batteries, sensors, and many other cutting-edge
technologies. They’re also a critical tool in designing and building useful
quantum…
