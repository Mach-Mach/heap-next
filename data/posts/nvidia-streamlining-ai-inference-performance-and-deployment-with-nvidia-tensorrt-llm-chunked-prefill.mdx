In this blog post, we take a closer look at chunked prefill, a feature of
NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM that increases GPU utilization and simplifies the
deployment experience for developers. This builds on our previous post
discussing how advanced KV cache optimization features in TensorRT-LLM improve
performance up to 5x in use cases that require system prefills. When a user
submits a request toâ€¦
