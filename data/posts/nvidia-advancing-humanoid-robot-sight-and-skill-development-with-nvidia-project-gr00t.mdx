Humanoid robots present a multifaceted challenge at the intersection of
mechatronics, control theory, and AI. The dynamics and control of humanoid
robots are complex, requiring advanced tools, techniques, and algorithms to
maintain balance during locomotion and manipulation tasks. Collecting robot
data and integrating sensors also pose significant challenges, as humanoid
robots require a fusion ofâ€¦
