[Kassow Robots](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/kassow-robots/) has
introduced a new line of compact collaborative robot arms (cobots) designed to
integrate with mobile robots. The new Edge Edition cobots are smaller, fully
integrated manipulators designed for mobile manipulation applications.

The new cobots feature a direct DC connection from battery power, enabling
them to operate while mounted to a mobile robot. They offer remote power
on/off control, allowing for control from the mobile robot controllers or a
PLC. The cobots can run in automatic mode without a teach pendant,
streamlining operations. The cobots have a standard footprint of 160x200mm
(6.2″x7.9″) ensuring compatibility with various applications.

Kassow Robots' cobots are equipped with sensors that detect overload, ensuring
safe operation in shared workspaces. This eliminates the need for special
safety measures, expanding the range of applications to include repetitive,
dangerous, and dirty tasks. However, a thorough risk assessment must be
conducted before deploying the cobots in any environment.

The cobots are also modular, leveraging Kassow Robots' existing partner
ecosystem that enables integration of various peripherals, grippers, vision
systems, or function extensions.

[Bosch Rexroth acquired a majority stake in Kassow Robots in March
2022](https://www.therobotreport.com/bosch-rexroth-acquiring-majority-of-
kassow-robots/) for an undisclosed amount. [Kassow Robots exited stealth mode
at Automatica 2018](https://www.therobotreport.com/kassow-robots-7dof-cobot-
arms-automatica/). It was co-founded in 2014 by Kristian Kassow, former co-
founder of [Universal Robots](http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/universal-
robots), which is the leading developer of cobots. Founded in 2005 by Kassow,
Esben Østergaard and Kasper Støy, Universal Robots was
[acquired](https://www.therobotreport.com/danish-co-bot-maker-universal-
robots-sells-for-350-million/) in 2015 by Teradyne for $285 million.

Kristian Kassow provides more insights about the [Edge Edition
cobots](https://www.kassowrobots.com/products/edge-edition) in the Q&A below.

**Why did you develop the Edge Edition?**

**Kristian Kassow:** Our goal has always been to make it as easy as possible
for our customers to integrate cobots into their production, with an explicit
focus on SMEs. Our Edge Edition offers multiple advantages here: it’s designed
for industrial use, offers a high level of maneuverability thanks to its 7
axes, and delivers unique compactness. It also has a small footprint of just
160 x 200 millimeters. That is because we have miniaturized the controller to
just 10 percent of the original size and integrated it into the robot base.
Another benefit worth mentioning is that the Edge Edition can be easily
connected to any DC power supply, such as the battery of a mobile robot.

**What customer groups are you targeting with the Edge Edition?**

**Kassow:** Lots of them, all industries with intralogistics tasks at their
production sites can benefit from our Edge Edition. The Edge Edition offers
the additional benefit of being a multifunctional cobot, allowing users to
switch between tasks seamlessly. This includes the ability to use it for the
production of Product A, followed by a quality check, and then for
palletizing.

The Edge Edition comes into play and shows off its advantages when a cobot
becomes an efficient assistant to mobile robots. We believe that mobile
applications will be the primary use for the Edge Edition. This means using
cobots in combination with an AMR or AGV.

**Can you tell us more about using a cobot as a mobile manipulator?**

**Kassow** : One way in which the cobot can be made mobile is by moving the
lightweight cobot installation to a new location and programming it for a new
application. The programming of a cobot is much easier than in the case of a
traditional industrial robot. Another way to make the most of mobility is to
use it for the same tasks that come up at various locations during the
production process. Let me give you an example. A combination of an AGV/ AMR
and a cobot can take over the task to take care of the loading of boxes that
will be used for packaging.

**Why does the Edge Edition contribute to an easy integration of AGV/AMR-cobot
solutions?**

**Kassow** : The Edge Edition saves space because the robot arm and controller
form a compact unit that can be installed quickly. In addition, as mentioned
earlier, the direct current (DC) connection on all Edge Edition cobots
satisfies all the requirements for connecting a cobot directly to the battery
of an AGV or AMR. At the end of the day, we want to make it easier for our
customers to integrate cobots into mobile solutions. A look at today’s AGVs
and AMRs quickly reveals just how little space they offer. Robot controllers
are mostly bulky, making it harder to automate tasks. Our Edge Edition cobots
feature a slim base. We help system integrators and end customers simplify the
implementation of these AGV/AMR & cobot solutions.
