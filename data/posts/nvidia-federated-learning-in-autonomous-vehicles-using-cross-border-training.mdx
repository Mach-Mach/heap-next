Federated learning is revolutionizing the development of autonomous vehicles
(AVs), particularly in cross-country scenarios where diverse data sources and
conditions are crucial. Unlike traditional machine learning methods that
require centralized data storage, federated learning enables AVs to
collaboratively train algorithms using locally collected data while keeping
the data decentralized.
