The energy industry’s digital transformation requires a substantial increase
in computational demands for key HPC workloads and applications. This trend is
exemplified by advanced seismic imaging methodologies such as reverse time
migration (RTM) and full waveform inversion (FWI), where doubling maximum
frequency can produce a 16x increase in computational workload. Similarly…
