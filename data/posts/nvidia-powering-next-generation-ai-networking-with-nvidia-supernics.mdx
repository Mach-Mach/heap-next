In the era of generative AI, accelerated networking is essential to build
high-performance computing fabrics for massively distributed AI workloads.
NVIDIA continues to lead in this space, offering state-of-the-art Ethernet and
InfiniBand solutions that maximize the performance and efficiency of AI
factories and cloud data centers. At the core of these solutions are NVIDIA
SuperNICs—a new…
