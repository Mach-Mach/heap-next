Johnson & Johnson MedTech announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration granted its Ottava surgical robot investigational device
exemption, or IDE.

The regulatory nod comes just under a month after the company [said it
submitted Ottava for IDE](https://www.massdevice.com/johnson-johnson-submits-
ottava-fda-ide-q3-2024/). It allows [Johnson & Johnson
MedTech](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/johnson-johnson/) to begin a
clinical trial for the robotic platform at U.S. sites. The company is now
preparing clinical trial sites to receive Ottava systems, enroll patients, and
begin surgical cases.

Johnson & Johnson first [shared details on the Ottava surgical robotic
platform](https://www.therobotreport.com/ottava-surgical-assistant-robot-
finally-unveiled-by-johnson-johnson/) about four years ago. However, since
then, the company has remained quiet on the topic, though. In October 2021,
J&J [pushed back the platform’s development timeline by about two
years](https://www.therobotreport.com/jj-delaying-ottava-surgical-robot-
by-2-years/) due to multiple factors.

The initial unveiling of Ottava highlighted a six-armed approach for the
robot. A November 2023 __[update](https://www.therobotreport.com/johnson-
johnson-plans-to-submit-ottava-surgical-robot-for-fda-ide-next-year/) shed
more light on Ottava and some changes in its look over the past three years.

The company said Ottava incorporates four robotic arms into a standard-size
surgical table. Its unified architecture allows for an "invisible design,"
according to J&J. The robotic arms are available when needed and are stowed
beneath the surgical table when not.

Johnson & Johnson MedTech said the design removes barriers to movement and
collaboration in robotic operating rooms. It also offers surgical teams the
freedom and flexibility to adapt to clinical workflows and individualize
patient needs.

“We are bringing the best of J&J MedTech’s surgery expertise to the Ottava
system and taking a holistic view of the science of surgery to enable new
experiences across all surgical modalities in service of patients around the
world,” said Hani Abouhalka, group chair for surgery at Johnson & Johnson
MedTech. “Meeting this milestone brings us a step closer to delivering on our
promise to make technology more human, care more adaptive, and people more
connected so that surgery works better for everyone.”

### Johnson & Johnson designs Ottava for versatility

Johnson & Johnson said it designed Ottava to set a new standard for the modern
operating room and transform the
[surgical](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/surgical/) experience. The
system’s unique architecture combines with J&J’s digital ecosystem to deliver
versatility in meeting patient and surgeon needs.

With the four low-profile robotic arms, the company designed Ottava to support
robotic, laparoscopic, hybrid, and open surgery with more working space for
clinical teams. The system’s architecture supports features like “twin motion”
in which the table and robotic arms move together. This aids in intraoperative
repositioning and multi-quadrant access without re-docking.

Ottava also exclusively features trusted Ethicon instrumentation designed for
performance and precision. J&J said this supports a more consistent experience
between traditional laparoscopic and robotic procedures.

The company said its Polyphonic digital ecosystem can connect the portfolio
across surgical technologies, robotics, and software while also using its
scale.

In the future, J&J said it expects Polyphonic to empower Ottava with data and
advanced insights. This would support clinical decision-making, learning and
collaboration.

“We are excited about reaching this important milestone and progressing our
differentiated general surgery robotic platform for the benefit of patients
and surgeons,” said Rocco De Bernardis, president of Ottava at Johnson &
Johnson MedTech. “With approval to move to clinical investigation, our teams
are focused on training clinical trial investigators and teams as they enroll
patients and prepare for cases.”
