As consumer applications generate more data than ever before, enterprises are
turning to causal inference methods for observational data to help shed light
on how changes to individual components of their app impact key business
metrics. Over the last decade, econometricians have developed a technique
called double machine learning that brings the power of machine learning
models to causalâ€¦
