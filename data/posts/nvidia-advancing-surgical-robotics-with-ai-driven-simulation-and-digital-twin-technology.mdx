The integration of robotic surgical assistants (RSAs) in operating rooms
offers substantial advantages for both surgeons and patient outcomes.
Currently operated through teleoperation by trained surgeons at a console,
these surgical robot platforms provide augmented dexterity that has the
potential to streamline surgical workflows and alleviate surgeon workloads.
