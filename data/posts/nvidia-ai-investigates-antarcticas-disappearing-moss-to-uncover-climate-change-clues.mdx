Antarctica plays a crucial role in regulating ‌Earth’s climate. Most climate
research into the world’s coldest, most windswept continent focuses on the
surrounding Southern Ocean’s carbon dioxide absorption, or its vast, sunlight-
reflecting glaciers. A group of Australian scientists is taking a different
approach. Researchers are diving deep into Antarctic moss beds, using an AI-
powered edge…
