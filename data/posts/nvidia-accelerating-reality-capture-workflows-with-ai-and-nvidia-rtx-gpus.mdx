Reality capture creates highly accurate, detailed, and immersive digital
representations of environments. Innovations in site scanning and accelerated
data processing, and emerging technologies like neural radiance fields (NeRFs)
and Gaussian splatting are significantly enhancing the capabilities of reality
capture. These technologies are revolutionizing interactions with and analyses
of theâ€¦
