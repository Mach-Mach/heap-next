The Automated Audio Captioning task centers around generating natural language
descriptions from audio inputs. Given the distinct modalities between the
input (audio) and the output (text), AAC systems typically rely on an audio
encoder to extract relevant information from the sound, represented as feature
vectors, which a decoder then uses to generate text descriptions.
