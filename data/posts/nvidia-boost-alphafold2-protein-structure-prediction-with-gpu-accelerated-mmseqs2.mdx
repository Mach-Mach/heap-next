The ability to compare the sequences of multiple related proteins is a
foundational task for many life science researchers. This is often done in the
form of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and the evolutionary information
retrieved from these alignments can yield insights into protein structure,
function, and evolutionary history. Now, with MMseqs2-GPU, an updated GPU-
acceleratedâ€¦
