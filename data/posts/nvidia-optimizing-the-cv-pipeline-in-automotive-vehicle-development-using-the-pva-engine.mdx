In the field of automotive vehicle software development, more large-scale AI
models are being integrated into autonomous vehicles. The models range from
vision AI models to end-to-end AI models for autonomous driving. Now the
demand for computing power is sharply increasing, leading to higher system
loads that can have a negative impact on system stability and latency.
