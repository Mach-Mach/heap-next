Robotics could make everyday life easier by taking on repetitive or time-
consuming tasks. At NVIDIA GTC 2024, researchers from Stanford University
unveiled BEHAVIOR-1K, a major benchmark designed to train robots to perform
1,000 real-world-inspired activities—such as folding laundry, cooking
breakfast, and cleaning up after a party. Using OmniGibson, a cutting-edge
simulation environment for…
