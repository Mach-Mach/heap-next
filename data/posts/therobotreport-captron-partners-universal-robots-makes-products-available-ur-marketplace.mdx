CAPTRON has announced its official UR+ partnership with Universal Robots A/S.
The global sensor provider said its TCP Calibration Sensors, now available on
the Universal Robots marketplace, deliver high precision and are integrated
with UR collaborative robot arms.

“Our UR+ certified products are designed to deliver maximum precision and
reliability to support our customers’ automation goals,” stated Sean Walters,
general manager at CAPTRON North America LP. “This partnership with Universal
Robots reinforces our commitment to delivering high-performance solutions that
are easy to integrate, boosting productivity across the board.”

Designed for applications like dispensing and
[welding](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/welding), these sensors can
maximize accuracy, reduce scrap, and enhance production quality, said CAPTRON.
The [company](https://www.captron.com/) claimed that its URCap software
enables manufacturers to achieve plug-and-play integration, speeding up
deployment and improving efficiency.

## CAPTRON sensors offer ease of use, precision

The TCP Laser Calibration Sensors are available in 40 mm (1.5 in.) and 70 mm
(0.2 in.) sizes. They offer precise tool tip calibration with a
reproducibility of 0.01 mm (0.0003 in.), said the company, which has locations
in the U.S., Germany, China, and Poland.

CAPTRON listed the following features and benefits for its URCap-compatible
TCP Calibration Sensors:

  * **Ease of use** : CAPTRON said its URCap software simplifies sensor setup, drastically cutting integration time.
  * **Reliability** : The [sensors](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/technologies/sensors-sensing/) promise precise and repeatable accuracy, minimizing tool deviations and errors.
  * **Flexibility** : With user-friendly software interfaces, manufacturers can switch between tasks quickly and easily, said CAPTRON, making its systems highly adaptable across various applications.

## Customer says TCP Calibration Sensor a ‘game changer’

Popular tool center point applications include checking the welder gun wire
tip after cleaning and calibrating the glue-dispensing tip before each process
to ensure precision.

One of CAPTRON’s newest customers recently implemented the TCP Calibration
Sensor and described it as a “game changer.” The customer said it has seen
dramatic improvements in tool precision, significantly reducing errors and
downtime.

CAPTRON said the use case highlights how its technology can enhance accuracy
and efficiency in automated industrial processes.

“Universal Robots is thrilled to partner with CAPTRON to drive the next wave
of innovation in collaborative robotics,” said Michael DeGrace, ecosystem
success manager for the Americas at [Universal
Robots](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/universal-robots). “By combining
CAPTRON’s cutting-edge sensor technology with our flexible, user-friendly
robotic arms, we are opening up new possibilities for industries worldwide to
enhance automation, improve precision, and achieve greater efficiency in their
operations.”
