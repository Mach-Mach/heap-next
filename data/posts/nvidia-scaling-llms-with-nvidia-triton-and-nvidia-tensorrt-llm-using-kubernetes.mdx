Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for chatbots, content
generation, summarization, classification, translation, and more. State-of-
the-art LLMs and foundation models, such as Llama, Gemma, GPT, and Nemotron,
have demonstrated human-like understanding and generative abilities. Thanks to
these models, AI developers do not need to go through the expensive and time
consuming trainingâ€¦
