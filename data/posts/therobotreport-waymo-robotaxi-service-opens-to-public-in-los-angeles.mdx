Anyone in Los Angeles can now take fully autonomous rides with Waymo One. The
company, whose service area covers Santa Monica, Hollywood Boulevard, USC, and
everything in between, has removed its waitlist in the city and is open 24/7.

It's only been about eight months since Waymo launched its limited robotaxi
service in Los Angeles. In that time, nearly 300,000 people joined its
waitlist. Waymo said these LA riders have taken hundreds of thousands of paid
trips across the city, and given Waymo valuable feedback about its
performance.

Waymo said its service has received an average 4.7 out of 5 star rating.
Additionally, 98% of riders recently surveyed in LA said they are satisfied
with the service and 96% find it useful.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the
ride,” said Tekedra Mawakana, the co-CEO of Waymo. “Our
[service](https://waymo.com/waymo-one/) has matured quickly and our riders are
embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to
all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The self-driving [unit](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/waymo/) of Alphabet
has spent 2024 expanding its self-driving services across multiple cities,
including in [San Francisco](https://www.therobotreport.com/waymo-ends-
waitlist-opens-robotaxi-service-all-san-francisco/) and
[Phoenix](https://www.therobotreport.com/waymo-expands-phoenix-service-area-
zoox-starts-testing-austin-miami/), where it provides curbside service at Sky
Harbor International Airport. In August, the company
[unveiled](https://www.therobotreport.com/new-waymo-robotaxis-offers-better-
performance-at-lower-cost/) its 6th generation robotaxi, equipped with an
optimized sensor suite for greater performance at a significantly reduced
cost. Most recently, it brought in $5.6 billion in
[funding](https://www.therobotreport.com/waymo-raises-5-6b-to-accelerate-self-
driving-car-growth/). Waymo also has a robotaxi service in Austin, but there's
a long waitlist, and the service isn't yet open to everyone.

## More about Waymo's LA service

Riders can now traverse nearly 80 square miles of LA County, and Waymo intends
to grow its service area to cover more of the city in the future. The company
said it looks forward to welcoming many first-time riders and welcoming back
those it has served over the last year, as it steadily scales its service over
time just as we’ve done in San Francisco and Phoenix.

As it opens its doors to more people, Waymo is working closely with local
community partners aligned with its mission to make roads safer and mobility
more accessible. For example, Waymo is working with She is Hope, a non-profit
dedicated to empowering single mothers in Los Angeles.

“Riding with Waymo was an incredible experience—smooth, safe, and truly
impressive,” said Tisha Janigan, founder of She is Hope. “When I rode alone
and with some of our single mother families, we were amazed by the driverless
technology and the sense of comfort it provided. Access to Waymo could be a
game-changer for women we serve, offering a nonjudgmental, reliable
transportation option that prioritizes safety.”

While Waymo is a clear leader in the autonomous vehicle industry, there are a
number of other companies hoping to breakthrough in the space. Amazon-
subsidiary Zoox this week [expanded](https://www.therobotreport.com/zoox-now-
testing-its-robotaxis-in-san-francisco/) its operation in California and
Nevada. The company is now testing its robotaxis in San Francisco and expanded
its Las Vegas geofence. Zoox is not offering public rides in either city yet,
but it hopes to launch its Las Vegas operation in early 2025.

Additionally, Chinese firms have been bringing in large amounts of money to
further develop their technology. Last week, DeepRout.ai brought in $100
million led by Chinese automotive manufacturer [Great Wall
Motor](https://www.gwm-global.com/). While WeRide last month
[brought](https://www.therobotreport.com/chinese-av-developer-weride-brings-
in-458-5m-from-ipo-private-placement/) in $485.5 million from its initial
public offering and private placement.
