Electric vehicle (EV) charging is getting a jolt with an innovative new AI
algorithm that boosts efficiency, reduces cost, and keeps the grid from short-
circuiting under pressure. Developed by a team of researchers from the Royal
Military College of Canada (RMC), the real-time smart solution optimizes
charging schedules for large parking lots, balancing quick charging with
energy availability.
