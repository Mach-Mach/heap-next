ZAP Surgical Systems Inc. this week said it has successfully closed a $78
million Series E funding round. The developer of non-invasive, robotic brain-
surgery tools said the new financing will advance the commercialization of its
ZAP-X Gyroscopic Radiosurgery platform.

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a well-established procedure for the non-
invasive treatment of many brain tumors including brain metastases,
meningiomas, and other intracranial disorders such as trigeminal neuralgia.
Considered an alternative to open surgery for these indications, SRS is an
outpatient procedure delivered in one to five brief treatments, according to
ZAP Surgical.

Compared to open surgery, however, the SRS procedure has proven to provide
equivalent to superior outcomes, claimed the San Carlos, Calif.-based
[company](https://zapsurgical.com/). It requires no
[surgical](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/surgical/) incision, inflicts no
pain, and typically requires little to no patient recovery period, it added.

“We founded ZAP Surgical to address a clear need: enabling more patients to
access state-of-the-art radiosurgery without the prohibitive costs and
infrastructure requirements that limit so many providers,” stated John R.
Adler, M.D., professor emeritus of neurosurgery at Stanford University, as
well as founder and CEO of ZAP Surgical Systems.

## ZAP-X promises to expand care

Each year, more than 5 million patients globally could benefit from
stereotactic radiosurgery, estimated ZAP Surgical Systems. However, because of
the cost and complexity of legacy technologies, only about 200,000 patients
receive optimal SRS care, it said.

With availability concentrated primarily among only the largest urban academic
hospitals, world-class radiosurgery has remained out of reach for an estimated
96% of patients who might benefit, said the company.

ZAP Surgical has developed the [ZAP-X](https://zapsurgical.com/zap-x/)
platform, a dedicated, non-invasive cranial radiosurgery system that
incorporates advanced gyroscopic technology. Its movement enables
radiosurgical beams to be directed from thousands of potential angles for
precise tumor targeting.

The company said its approach prioritizes the protection of healthy brain
tissue and aims to preserve patient cognitive function. In addition, it said
the vault-free and cobalt-free design of ZAP-X eliminates the need for costly
shielded treatment rooms and removes the traditional requirement to manage,
secure, and replace radioactive isotopes for radiation beam production.

## Baheal Medical partners with ZAP Surgical

Qingdao Baheal Medical Inc. led ZAP Surgical's Series E round, which also
included participation from other strategic investors. [Baheal
Medical](http://en.baiyyy.com/) is a leading healthcare company in China.

“This partnership with Baheal Medical perfectly aligns with our mission,
providing ZAP-X with a powerful platform to reach millions of underserved
patients globally,” said Adler.

“We are thrilled to partner with ZAP Surgical in expanding access to cutting-
edge radiosurgery technology," added Fu Gang, chairman and president of Baheal
Medical. "ZAP-X’s innovative approach aligns with our commitment to delivering
advanced healthcare solutions that address pressing clinical needs. Together,
we are poised to promote how brain tumors and other intracranial diseases are
treated, providing more precise alternatives that greatly enhance patients’
quality of life."
