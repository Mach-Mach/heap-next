Pharmaceutical research demands fast, efficient simulations to predict how
molecules interact, speeding up drug discovery. Jiqun Tu, a senior developer
technology engineer at NVIDIA, and Ellery Russell, tech lead for the Desmond
engine at Schrödinger, explore advanced GPU optimization techniques designed
to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations. In this NVIDIA GTC 2024 session…
