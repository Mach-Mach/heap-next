There’s never enough time to do everything, even in engineering education.
Employers want engineers capable of wielding simulation tools to expedite
iterative research, design, and development. Some instructors try to address
this by teaching for weeks or months, on derivations of numerical methods,
approaches to discretization, the intricacies of turbulence models, and more.
Unfortunately…
