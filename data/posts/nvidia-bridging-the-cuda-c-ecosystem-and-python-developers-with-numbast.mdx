By enabling CUDA kernels to be written in Python similar to how they can be
implemented within C++, Numba bridges the gap between the Python ecosystem and
the performance of CUDA. However, CUDA C++ developers have access to many
libraries that presently have no exposure in Python. These include the CUDA
Core Compute Libraries (CCCL), cuRAND, and header-based implementations of
numeric typesâ€¦
