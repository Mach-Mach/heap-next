Confidential and self-sovereign AI is a new approach to AI development,
training, and inference where the user’s data is decentralized, private, and
controlled by the users themselves. This post explores how the capabilities of
Confidential Computing (CC) are expanded through decentralization using
blockchain technology. The problem being solved is most clearly shown through
the use of…
