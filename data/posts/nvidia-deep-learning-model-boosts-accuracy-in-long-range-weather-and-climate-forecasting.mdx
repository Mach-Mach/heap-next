Dale Durran, a professor in the Atmospheric Sciences Department at the
University of Washington, introduces a breakthrough deep learning model that
combines atmospheric and oceanic data to set new climate and weather
prediction accuracy standards. In this NVIDIA GTC 2024 session, Durran
presents techniques that reduce reliance on traditional parameterizations,
enabling the model to bypassâ€¦
