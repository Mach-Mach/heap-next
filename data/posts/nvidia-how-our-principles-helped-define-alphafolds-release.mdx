summary: Our Operating Principles have come to define both our commitment to prioritising widespread benefit, as well as the areas of research and applications we refuse to pursue. These principles have been at the heart of our decision making since DeepMind was founded, and continue to be refined as the AI landscape changes and grows. They are designed for our role as a research-driven science company and consistent with Google’s AI principles.
