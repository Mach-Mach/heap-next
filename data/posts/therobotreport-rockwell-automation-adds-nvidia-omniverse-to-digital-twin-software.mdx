Rockwell Automation is integrating NVIDIA Omniverse application programming
interfaces (APIs) into its Emulate3D digital twin software. Rockwell
Automation said this integration will enhance factory operations through
artificial intelligence (AI) and physics-based simulation technology.

Rockwell Automation's [Emulate3D](https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-
us/products/software/factorytalk/designsuite/emulate3d-digital-twin.html)
software uses [NVIDIA](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/nvidia/)
[Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) APIs to create factory-
scale dynamic digital twins based on OpenUSD interoperability and NVIDIA RTX
rendering technologies. While visualization was previously possible, this
enhancement enables true emulation and dynamic testing of multiple machines
within a system, Rockwell said. The integration is planned for early 2025 and
will enable improved visualization and simulation capabilities for
manufacturing environments.

"Our integration of Emulate3D with NVIDIA Omniverse marks a significant leap
forward in bringing autonomous operations to life," said Blake Moret, chairman
and CEO of Rockwell Automation. "By combining our deep industrial expertise
with NVIDIA's cutting-edge technology, we're helping our customers achieve new
levels of efficiency, innovation, and collaboration in their manufacturing
processes."

Rockwell Automation is dedicated to industrial automation and digital
transformation. The Milwaukee, Wis.-based
[company](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/rockwell-automation/) employs
27,000 people in more than 100 countries as of fiscal year-end 2024.

The company's Emulate3D digital twin software helps users preemptively
identify potential control issues, saving time and resources during
implementation. Plant personnel receive additional support by having a virtual
space to train on new systems, predict future performance, and simulate line
changes without real-world consequences.

## NVIDIA Omniverse enables digital twins at scale, Rockwell said

Digital twins enhance equipment development and control testing through
simulation models and emulation, reducing startup time and risk. As equipment
is connected into lines, models scale and challenges arise from siloed
expertise and integration issues between separately engineered components.

A system-level perspective, including interoperability across machines, can
solve these issues, but requires collaboration for system-level testing. As
lines scale, larger digital twins require more computational power, risking
bottlenecks. Automation leaders need scalable solutions to achieve full
factory-scale models, building on digital twin successes.

By using NVIDIA Omniverse, Emulate3D will allow multiple dynamic digital twins
to be combined and visualized as a complete factory through a web app. This
vendor-agnostic, scalable approach aims to address the growing need for
factory-scale digital twins created by engineers collaborating across various
teams. Rockwell Automation's expertise in industrial automation and
Emulate3D's comprehensive modeling capabilities pair with the NVIDIA Omniverse
platform to enable real-time collaboration at scale.

Rockwell said manufacturers will benefit from:

  * Hyperscale capabilities through Emulate3D’s multi-model technology
  * Cloud-based deployment options for maximum flexibility
  * Vendor-agnostic connectivity to a wide range of 3D applications
  * A unified web app for stakeholder visualization

NVIDIA Omniverse lets developers integrate various factory layers into a
comprehensive model, combining architectural software with industrial digital
twins. This enables greater coordination across industrial design and
operation. Built for scalability, Omniverse’s Universal Scene Description
(OpenUSD) foundations and cloud deployments grow alongside projects. This
means it helps meet customer demands for even the most complex endeavors.

Rockwell said this system is particularly valuable for industries with
complex, hybrid applications. These include consumer packaged goods, food and
beverage, life sciences, semiconductor manufacturing, automotive, and material
handling.
