The evolution of linear programming (LP) solvers has been marked by
significant milestones over the past century, from Simplex to the interior
point method (IPM). The introduction of primal-dual linear programming (PDLP)
has brought another significant advancement. NVIDIA cuOpt has now implemented
PDLP with GPU acceleration. Using cutting-edge algorithms, NVIDIA hardwareâ€¦
