AI and scientific computing applications are great examples of distributed
computing problems. The problems are too large and the computations too
intensive to run on a single machine. These computations are broken down into
parallel tasks that are distributed across thousands of compute engines, such
as CPUs and GPUs. To achieve scalable performance, the system relies on
dividing workloadsâ€¦
