Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is essential for developing
AI systems that are aligned with human values and preferences. RLHF enables
the most capable LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Nemotron families, to
generate exceptional responses. By integrating human feedback into the
training process, RLHF enables models to learn more nuanced behaviors and make
decisions thatâ€¦
