The growth of AI is driving exponential growth in computing power and a
doubling of networking speeds every few years. Less well-known is that it’s
also putting new demands on storage. Training new models typically requires
high-bandwidth networked access to petabytes of data, while inference with the
latest types of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) requires low-latency
access to…
