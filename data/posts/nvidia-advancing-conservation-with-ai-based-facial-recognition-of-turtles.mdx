summary: We came across Zindi – a dedicated partner with complementary goals – who are the largest community of African data scientists and host competitions that focus on solving Africa’s most pressing problems. Our Science team’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I) team worked with Zindi to identify a scientific challenge that could help advance conservation efforts and grow involvement in AI. Inspired by Zindi’s bounding box turtle challenge, we landed on a project with the potential for real impact: turtle facial recognition.
