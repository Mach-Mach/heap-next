Researchers at UCLA have developed a new AI model that can expertly analyze 3D
medical images of diseases in a fraction of the time it would otherwise take a
human clinical specialist. The deep-learning framework, named SLIViT (SLice
Integration by Vision Transformer), analyzes images from different imagery
modalities, including retinal scans, ultrasound videos, CTs, MRIs, and othersâ€¦
