Robotic dexterous grasping is a critical area of research and development,
aimed at enabling robots to interact with and manipulate objects as flexibly
as humans can. By enabling robots to handle complex tasks that require fine
motor skills, dexterous grasping can significantly enhance productivity and
efficiency. The first step to enabling human-like dexterous object
manipulation for robotsâ€¦
