Developers in the fields of image-guided surgery and surgical vision face
unique challenges in creating systems and applications that can significantly
improve surgical workflows. One such challenge is efficiently combining multi-
modal imaging data, such as preoperative 3D patient images with intra-
operative video. This is key to providing surgeons with real-timeâ€¦
