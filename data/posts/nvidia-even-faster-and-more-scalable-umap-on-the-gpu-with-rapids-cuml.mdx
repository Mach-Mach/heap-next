UMAP is a popular dimension reduction algorithm used in fields like
bioinformatics, NLP topic modeling, and ML preprocessing. It works by creating
a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) graph, which is known in literature as an all-
neighbors graph, to build a fuzzy topological representation of the data,
which is used to embed high-dimensional data into lower dimensions. RAPIDS
cuML already containedâ€¦
