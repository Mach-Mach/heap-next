summary: 'Using machine learning to train information retrieval models — such as Internet search engines — is difficult because it requires so much manually annotated data. Of course, training most machine learning systems requires manually annotated data, but because information retrieval models must handle such a wide variety of queries, they require a lot of data. Consequently, most information retrieval systems rely primarily on mechanisms other than machine learning.'
