Details are scarce at the moment, but Agility Robotics has a new strategic
partnership. Schaeffler AG, a global leader in motion technology, is making a
minority investment into Agility and buying Digit humanoid robots for use
across its global plant network.

The companies did not disclose the size of the investment, the number of
[humanoids](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-
platforms/humanoids/) being purchased, or what they will be used for. [_The
Robot Report_](https://www.therobotreport.com/) reached out to [Agility
Robotics](http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/agility-robotics) and
[Schaeffler](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/schaeffler/) for more details,
but both companies declined to comment.

"In disruptive times, implementing innovative manufacturing solutions is
crucial to be successful," said Andreas Schick, chief operating officer of
Schaeffler. "Here, humanoids play an important role. We, at Schaeffler, will
integrate this technology into our operations and see the potential to deploy
a significant number of humanoids in our global network of 100 plants by 2030.
We look forward to the collaboration with Agility Robotics which will
accelerate our activities in this field."

Agility Robotics [won the inaugural RBR50 Robot of the Year
Award](https://www.therobotreport.com/rbr50-2024/) from _The Robot Report_
earlier in 2024. It was recognized for showcasing Digit's ability to perform
real-world work in pilots [with
Amazon](https://www.therobotreport.com/humanoids-getting-their-feet-wet-in-
logistics/) and [GXO Logistics](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/gxo-
logistics/).

While the pilot with Amazon has been relatively quiet, [GXO officially
deployed a “small fleet” of Digit
humanoids](https://www.therobotreport.com/agility-robotics-digit-humanoid-
lands-first-official-job/) at a Spanx facility in Georgia. The Digit humanoids
pick up totes from 6 River Systems‘ Chuck autonomous mobile robots
([AMRs](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/amrs/)) and
place the totes onto conveyors.

Agility claimed that it was the first company to commercially deploy
humanoids. It also asserted that the GXO deal was the first robots-as-a-
service ([RaaS](https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/category/raas/))
implementation of such robots.

## Humanoid development marches on

Many other companies are also developing humanoids for commercial use,
including [Apptronik](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/apptronik), [Boston
Dynamics](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/boston-dynamics),
[Figure](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/figure-ai/), and [Sanctuary
AI](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/sanctuary-ai/), to name a few. None of
them, however, appear to have deployed their humanoids with customers beyond
[small trials](https://www.therobotreport.com/bmw-testing-figure-01-humanoid-
spartanburg-automotive-plant/).

"We are excited to welcome Schaeffler as a customer and investor, and look
forward to delivering value in their operations with Digit," said Peggy
Johnson, who [took over as Agility Robotics' CEO in March
2024](https://www.therobotreport.com/veteran-tech-exec-peggy-johnson-named-
agility-robotics-ceo/). “While our technology is helping companies like
Schaeffler transform their manufacturing, logistics, and warehousing
businesses, scaling the use of humanoid robots will require them to work
cooperatively with humans and outside of the safety cages they are in today."

"I am confident that in the next 24 months, Agility will be the first company
to deliver a safe humanoid robot that will be able to work alongside people,"
she stated.

There currently are no [safety](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/safety)
standards for humanoids. However, various efforts are under way to explore a
path forward for relevant standards. The [IEEE Humanoids Study Group just
released](https://www.therobotreport.com/humanoid-study-group-launches-survey-
on-human-robot-interaction/) a survey to better understand how human-robot
interaction might affect the development of standards for humanoids.

Late last month, Boston Dynamics [released an impressive
video](https://www.therobotreport.com/atlas-humanoid-robot-shows-increasing-
competence-in-latest-boston-dynamics-video/) of its new electric Atlas
humanoid. The video shows the robot handling large automotive parts
autonomously. The company said Atlas uses machine learning to execute its
tasks and 3D vision to perceive the world around it.
