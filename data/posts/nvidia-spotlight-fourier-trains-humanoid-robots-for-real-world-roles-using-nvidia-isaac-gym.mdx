This post was written in partnership with the Fourier research team. Training
humanoid robots to operate in fields that demand high levels of interaction
and adaptability—such as scientific research, healthcare and manufacturing—can
be a challenging and resource-intensive feat. Fourier, a Shanghai-based
robotics company, is doing the heavy lifting by developing advanced humanoid
robots…
