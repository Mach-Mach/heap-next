Neuromodulation is a technique that enhances or restores brain function by
directly intervening in neural activity. It is commonly used to treat
conditions like Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and depression. The shift from
open-loop to closed-loop neuromodulation strategies enables on-demand
modulation, improving therapeutic effects while reducing side effects. This
could lead to significant…
