A new deep learning model could reduce the need for surgery when diagnosing
whether cancer cells are spreading, including to nearby lymph nodes—also known
as metastasis. Developed by researchers from the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, the AI tool analyzes time-series MRIs and
clinical data to identify metastasis, providing crucial, noninvasive support
for doctors in treatment…
