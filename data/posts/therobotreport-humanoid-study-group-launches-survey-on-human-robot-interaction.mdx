The IEEE Humanoids Study Group was [formed in June
2024](https://www.therobotreport.com/ieee-launches-study-group-explore-
develop-humanoid-robot-standards/) and initiated the process of evaluating the
current safety standards that might impact the safe design and deployment of
humanoid robots. The group's goal is not to develop any standards, but rather
to do the homework that will tee up the development of new standards, or the
revision of existing standards, to cover the needs of humanoids.

Many companies are currently developing humanoids for commercial use,
including [Agility Robotics](http://www.therobotreport.com/tag/agility-
robotics), [Apptronik](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/apptronik), [Boston
Dynamics](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/boston-dynamics),
[Figure](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/figure), and many others. Agility
Robotics' Digit is widely seen as the leader in the clubhouse at the moment
because actually [deployed commercially with

The [group](https://www.ieee-ras.org/industry-government/standards/active-
projects/study-group-humanoid-robots) aims to complete its market research and
final report within a year. Subsequently, Standards Development Organizations
(SDOs) will require an additional 1-2 years to develop and ratify any new
standards. Consequently, it will take a minimum of 18 to 30 months before
humanoid robots can adhere to the necessary safety standards, a crucial step
towards mitigating risks in their deployment. This report is planned for
release in May 2025.

The Study Group is split into two subgroups: one subgroup is actively
reviewing all existing robot safety standards, while the second human-robot
interaction (HRI) subgroup is evaluating all of the various use cases for
humanoids.

The HRI subgroup has been tasked with determining what aspects of HRI might
impact the development and application of standards when it comes to
humanoids. To help the team achieve this goal, they have put together a
12-question survey, divided into three thematic sections. If you would like to
contribute to the initiative, please answer as many of the questions below as
possible to help determine what aspects of HRI will impact the development of
robotic standards with respect to the real-world applications of humanoid
robots.
