Improving sources of sustainable energy is a worldwide problem with
environmental and economic security implications. Ying-Yi Hong, distinguished
professor of Power Systems and Energy at Chung Yuan Christian University in
Taiwan, researches hybrid quantum-classical methods. These approaches leverage
quantum computing to solve challenging problems in power systems and
sustainable energy.
