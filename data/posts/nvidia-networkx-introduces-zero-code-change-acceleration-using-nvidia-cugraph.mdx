NetworkX accelerated by NVIDIA cuGraph is a newly released backend co-
developed with the NetworkX team. NVIDIA cuGraph provides GPU acceleration for
popular graph algorithms such as PageRank, Louvain, and betweenness
centrality. Depending on the algorithm and graph size, it can significantly
accelerate NetworkX workflows, up to 50x, even 500x over NetworkX on CPU. In
