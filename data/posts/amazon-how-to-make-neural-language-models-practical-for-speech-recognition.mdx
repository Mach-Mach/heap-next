summary: 'An automatic-speech-recognition system — such as Alexa’s — converts speech into text, and one of its key components is its language model. Given a sequence of words, the language model computes the probability that any given word is the next one. For instance, a language model would predict that a sentence that begins “Toni Morrison won the Nobel” is more likely to conclude “Prize” than “dries”. Language models can thus help decide between competing interpretations of the same acoustic information.'
