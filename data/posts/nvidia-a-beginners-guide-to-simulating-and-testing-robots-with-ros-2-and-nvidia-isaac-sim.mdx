Physical AI-powered robots need to autonomously sense, plan, and perform
complex tasks in the physical world. These include transporting and
manipulating objects safely and efficiently in dynamic and unpredictable
environments. Robot simulation enables developers to train, simulate, and
validate these advanced systems through virtual robot learning and testing. It
all happens in physics…
