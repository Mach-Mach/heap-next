LOXO AG today opened its first international subsidiary in Munich, Germany.
The Bern, Switzerland-based company has developed and deployed software-as-a-
service, or SaaS, systems to provide autonomy to delivery vehicles.

“Germany is a natural next step for LOXO as we continue our mission to
revolutionize commercial vehicle automation in Europe,” said Amin Amini, CEO
of LOXO. “Germany’s strong logistics market, advanced automotive
infrastructure, and progressive legislation surrounding autonomous vehicles
make it the ideal location for us to further our middle-mile and mobile
distribution projects.”

Amin Amini, Lara Amini, and Claudio Panizza founded the company in 2018. LOXO
claimed that its vehicle-agnostic LOXO Digital Driver (LDD) software can give
nearly any commercial vehicle [SAE](https://www.sae.org/blog/sae-j3016-update)
Level 4 autonomy.

In addition, the company operates its own fleet of logistics vehicles, the
electric LOXO Alpha and LOXO R1.

## LOXO begins with autonomous deliveries in Bern

LOXO recently rolled out what it said was Europe's first L4 self-driving
technology, which is operational on public roads in Bern. The company, which
began with [remote
operation](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/teleoperation), has authorized
autonomous driving routes spanning 65 km (40 mi.) within the city.

"The LDD software serves as the core of every autonomous operation, combining
advanced AI with an autonomous sensor stack to enable vehicles to drive
autonomously," explained the company on its
[website](https://www.loxo.ch/en/). "Our virtual mapping approach
significantly enhances scalability, ensuring operations remain fast and cost-
effective."

Last year, it conducted projects with Schindler Group and Migros,
Switzerland's largest online retailer. Its [autonomous
vehicles](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/self-
driving-vehicles/) are currently proving their capabilities in [projects with
Planzer](https://www.therobotreport.com/planzer-and-loxo-roll-out-urban-pilot-
for-autonomous-vehicles-in-switzerland/), a major Swiss logistics company.

## German middle-mile market presents an opportunity

"Germany’s middle-mile logistics sector, valued at approximately $379.89
billion in 2023 and projected to surpass $504 billion by 2032, has enormous
untapped potential," asserted LOXO. "The repetitive nature of [middle-
mile](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/middle-mile-delivery/) routes between
business hubs presents an ideal opportunity for autonomous driving solutions."

Lara Amini, co-founder and current chief business officer of LOXO Switzerland,
will lead the new Munich subsidiary.

“We’re not just focused on replacing traditional vehicles with autonomous
ones. Our goal is to foster innovation that will catalyze the transformation
of the entire logistics sector,” said Lara Amini. “By collaborating with local
partners and tapping into Germany’s pool of talent, we aim to take LOXO’s
successful model and scale it across new markets.”

The company said its expansion into
[Germany](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/germany/) signals its commitment
to advancing autonomous driving in one of Europe’s largest
[logistics](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-
industries/logistics-warehousing-asrs/) markets. It said it aims to further
integrate its vehicles into the supply chain and advance the state of
commercial vehicle automation.
