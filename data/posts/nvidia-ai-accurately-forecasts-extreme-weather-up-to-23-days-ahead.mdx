New research from the University of Washington is refining AI weather models
using deep learning for more accurate predictions and longer-term forecasts.
The study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, shows how adjusting
initial atmospheric data enables advanced AI models to extend current forecast
limits. As extreme weather becomes increasingly more severe and frequent due
to climateâ€¦
