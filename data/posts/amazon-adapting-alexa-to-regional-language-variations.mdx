summary: 'As Alexa expands into new countries, she usually has to be trained on new languages. But sometimes, she has to be re-trained on languages sheâ€™s already learned. British English, American English, and Indian English, for instance, are different enough that for each of them, we trained a new machine learning model from scratch.'
