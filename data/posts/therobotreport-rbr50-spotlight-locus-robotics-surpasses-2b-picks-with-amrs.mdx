**Organization:** Locus Robotics Corp.  
**Country:** U.S.  
**Website:** _<https://locusrobotics.com/>_  
**Year Founded:** 2014  
**Number of Employees:** 51-100  
**Innovation Class:** Application & Market

In August 2023, autonomous mobile robot
([AMR](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-platforms/amrs/))
developer Locus Robotics surpassed 2 billion picks for its warehouse
fulfillment customers. The milestone came just 11 months after it surpassed
the 1 billion pick mark in 2022, for which the
[company](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/locus-robotics/) also won an
RBR50 Robotics Innovation Award.

![rbr50 banner logo.](https://www.therobotreport.com/wp-
content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-01-at-7.46.09 PM.png)"Achieving the
2 billion picks milestone is an incredible accomplishment or our company and
for our customers," said Rick Faulk, CEO of Locus Robotics, at the time. “This
event is a testament to the dedication and innovation of our incredible team
and the dramatic productivity improvements we deliver to drive our customers’
growth and success.”

It took Locus just 358 days to go from 1 billion to 2 billion, with the last
100 million picks taking just 27 days. That’s an average of 3.7 million picks
per day. By comparison, it took more than six years to make the first billion
picks and 1,542 days to pick the first 100 million units.

“Locus’ consistent innovation, user-centric approach, and genuine dedication
to customer relationships put them at the forefront of warehouse automation,”
said Alan McDonald, vice president of continuous improvement at GEODIS. “This
milestone is a testament to its technological leadership and synergistic
collaboration. We look forward to building on our work together and driving
even greater efficiency improvements in the future.”

Warehouse operators are increasingly turning to AMRs to meet growing demand
and overcome labor shortages. And Locus Robotics continues to lead the way.
Its mobile robots support more than 120 of the world's top brands and are
deployed at 300-plus sites globally.

The Wilmington, Mass.-based
[company](https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/tag/locus-robotics/) said
it enables retailers, third-party logistics providers (3PLs), and specialty
warehouses to efficiently meet and exceed the increasingly complex and
demanding requirements of today's fulfillment environment.

Since the its 2024 RBR50 award, Locus passed the [3 billion pick mark in
April](https://www.therobotreport.com/locus-robotics-surpasses-3b-picks-
just-33-weeks-after-last-milestone/) and the [4 billion pick mark in
October](https://www.automatedwarehouseonline.com/locus-robotics-systems-
reach-4b-picks-as-automation-accelerates/).
