Programming robots for real-world success requires a training process that
accounts for unpredictable conditions, different surfaces, variations in
object size, shape, texture, and more. Consequently, physically accurate
simulations are vital for training AI-enabled robots before deployment.
Crafting physically accurate simulation requires advanced programming skills
to fine-tune algorithmsâ€¦
