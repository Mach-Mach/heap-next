Like other industries, raspberry growers face growing labor challenges.
Fieldwork Robotics Ltd. today announced that it has signed a collaboration
agreement with Augean Robotics Inc., manufacturer of the Burro autonomous and
collaborative mobile robot.

Fieldwork Robotics is developing an autonomous raspberry-harvesting robot. The
Cambridge, U.K.-based [company](https://fieldworkrobotics.com/) said it has
designed the adaptive and modular system to harvest at the same quality as the
average fruit picker and to boost grower productivity.

Fieldwork added that it is combining cutting-edge hardware and software to
provide [growers](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-
industries/ag/) with efficient, cost-effective, and
[sustainable](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/sustainability/) harvesting
solutions. It noted that it has strong commercial partnerships with key
raspberry industry players in its target markets to support product
development.

“Burro is the perfect partner for Fieldwork as we continue to develop our
product offering," stated David Fulton, CEO of Fieldwork Robotics. "The team’s
expertise in autonomous agricultural robots has been an invaluable addition as
we continue to develop. This collaboration is a significant milestone for us,
and we look forward to delivering an enhanced service to our customers."

## Growers face labor, interoperability challenges

As labor costs grow because of minimum wage increases and the availability of
seasonal workers is limited, raspberry growers have been particularly
affected, according to Fieldwork Robotics. Farmers are increasingly looking to
innovative technologies to address these challenges, it said.

However, even when growers are interested in integrating robotics into their
harvesting practices, they face problems with initial cost of equipment and
lack of compatibility between different technologies, Fieldwork said. It
asserted that systems need to be
[interoperable](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/interoperability/) to
ensure that farmers can integrate robots into their operations in a cost-
effective way.

In response, the partners have created and demonstrated a base-agnostic
payload that can run on autonomous platforms including Burro. Fieldwork and
Burro said [Fieldworker 1](https://www.therobotreport.com/fieldwork-robotics-
unveils-fieldworker-1-robot-efficient-berry-picking/) is also compatible with
brands such as OxDrive, which makes integrated electric drives.

"Interoperability of technology is a huge advantage to growers and will afford
Fieldwork’s customers greater flexibility and lower operating costs," said
Fieldwork.

## Fieldwork and Burro partnership bears fruit

"Fieldwork has recently released its updated autonomous raspberry-harvesting
robot, which has benefitted from Burro’s expertise," said Fulton. "A
collaboration with an excellent partner like Burro serves to significantly
strengthen our first-mover advantage.”

The Burro robot incorporates machine learning, high-precision GPS and "Pop-Up
Autonomy" to transport produce across fields. Like Fieldwork, the
[company](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/augean-robotics)'s technology is
designed to enhance agricultural work and address labor shortages.

The Fieldworker 1, run on Burro's base, has successfully completed field
trials at [Place UK Ltd.](https://placeuk.com/), a grower of Driscoll’s
berries. The robot is currently on track to participate in field trials with
leading berry grower [Costa Group](https://costagroup.com.au/)'s Australian
farms in 2025.

“Seeing Fieldwork’s technology operating in the field has been fascinating,"
said Dan Yordanov, head of fresh at Place UK. "We were very pleased to work
with David and the team to test the Fieldworker 1 at Place UK, and we are
confident that it will be an invaluable harvesting solution to growers in the
future.”

Burro recently [raised](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/burro-
closes-24-million-series-b-co-led-by-catalyst-investors-and-translink-
capital-302029256.html) $24 million in Series B funding. Last month,
[Burro](https://burro.ai/) exhibited at
[RoboBusiness](https://www.robobusiness.com/), and Andersen participated in a
[session](https://www.therobotreport.com/learn-how-to-overcome-the-challenges-
of-building-outdoor-robots-at-robobusiness/) on the challenges of building
outdoor robots. Fieldwork said the
[company](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/burro/)'s success in Fieldwork’s
target markets make it a suitable partner.

“Fieldwork’s technology is truly world-class. It has been a pleasure to work
with David and the team as they developed their technology," said Charlie
Andersen, CEO of Burro. "Our combined expertise in robotics and automation
facilitated an interactive and highly effective partnership. We’re excited to
see where our partnership with the company takes us next, and our customers
are hugely excited about their solution to autonomous harvesting!”
