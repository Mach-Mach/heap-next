As development continues on humanoid robots, one mobile robot is already at
work in hospitals. Diligent Robotics Inc. today announced that its Moxi robot
has completed 110,000 autonomous elevator rides at health systems across the
U.S.

The mobile manipulator has a single arm for opening doors and pushing buttons
to operate elevators. Moxi's achievement marks a milestone in artificial
intelligence-driven automation for unstructured healthcare environments, said
the Austin, Texas-based [company](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/diligent-
robotics/).

"Achieving autonomy in robotics, particularly in health care environments, is
an incredible challenge," stated Andrea Thomaz, CEO of Diligent Robotics and a
20-year AI veteran. "Navigating elevators seems simple, but the unpredictable
nature of shared spaces, real-time changes, and the need for accuracy make it
one of many hard tasks that humanoids deployed in human environments need to
solve."

"With Moxi, weâ€™ve demonstrated the ability to integrate AI into environments
where collaboration between people and robots is vital for success," she
added. "As of today, we are completing over 20,000 fully autonomous elevator
rides each month, something none of our competitors are doing."

## Moxi moves to greater autonomy

Founded in 2017, Diligent Robotics noted that it has integrated Moxi into
existing [healthcare](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/markets-
industries/biotechnology-medical-healthcare/) workflows, such as delivering
supplies and transporting laboratory specimens around the clock. The
[company](https://www.diligentrobots.com/) said [its
robot](https://www.diligentrobots.com/moxi) has helped improve operational
efficiency and enabled busy staffers to focus on patient care rather than
routine transport tasks.

Diligent Robotics used "humans in the loop" to develop Moxi's autonomy and
ability to interact with elevators.

"There are two approaches: Waymo, which used its own drivers and did R&D until
its product was fully autonomous, and Tesla, which got its product out in the
wild with real customers and has increased autonomy with supervision over
time," Thomaz told [_The Robot Report_](https://www.therobotreport.com/). "We
took the latter approach."

"This milestone means we no longer need close human supervision, which is a
significant one for mobile manipulation," she said. "The number of rides per
day really shows that we've gotten past R&D and are working in production."

When it first deployed its robots, Diligent staffers supervised operations on
site. They obtained labeled data for AI models, explained Thomaz. The company
can now supervise its fleet of 100 robots in 20 sites remotely.

"A lot of our early partner hospitals got used to our staffers being around to
do everything the robots would need," Thomaz said. "In fact, it has been
easier for hospitals taken live in the past few months, because they had fully
autonomous robots from the start. For sites that were previously under human
supervision, we went through a data-collection phase and asked the staff not
to do anything."

## Moxi opens doors, a model for other actions

How hard was it to get Moxi to operate elevators?

"They became a roadmap for autonomy," replied Thomaz. "Nearly every delivery
pass involves an elevator req, from the pharmacy or lab in the basement up to
the patient wards. For the simplest elevator, you push a button and get on."

"The most complex one in operation today, you have to scan a badge to activate
the buttons and then push them," she told _The Robot Report_. "There are a lot
of patient floors that are secure. It's a complex manipulation skill for a
dual device, primarily because of the speed of swiping."

By solving the problems of manipulating a variety of doors and elevators,
Diligent Robotics is developing end-to-end action models.

"Our ability to develop models that are specific to these small skills is
creating an infrastructure of training models that could then be applied to
other skills," Thomaz said. "They're not large, general-purpose models, but
we're excited to have a fleet we can leverage to build foundation models."

## Complex environments still pose challenges

As environments with trained but busy personnel, a high degree of safety
regulations, and the general public -- some of whom are not well --
[hospitals](https://www.therobotreport.com/?s=hospital%20&page=1) are
particularly challenging for robots.

"That's why we treated this with white gloves; we're not just dropping robots
in to learn on their own," noted Thomaz. "We spent two years deploying robots
with people because of the sensitive environment and to get the robots to
operate efficiently."

For instance, she cited interventions where healthcare staffers push the
emergency stop button and can manually move a robot out of the way for
something like an urgent gurney. They sometimes forget to turn the robot back
on so it can continue its mission.

"We've released a feature where the robot can ask on its screen for someone to
un-e-stop it," Thomaz said. "There are other environments, such as an elevator
bay with six different cars and patients coming in and out, that are still
complex."

"Moxi also uses data to avoid routes or elevators that are always busy," she
said. "We collect that data and have preferred elevator bays for at night
versus during the day."

## Diligent Robotics works to normalize robots

With aging populations and workforce challenges, demand for automation is
likely to grow, said Diligent Robotics. Moxi provides an example of how robots
can address human needs, it said.

"I've been talking about Moxi as a 'humanoid for healthcare.' We're doing the
things that people are talking about what
[humanoids](https://www.therobotreport.com/category/robots-
platforms/humanoids/) could do," Thomaz said. "Bipedal locomotion isn't the
hardest part -- it's applicability of [mobile
manipulation](https://www.therobotreport.com/tag/mobile-manipulation/). Most
humanoids are still proofs of concept."

"When I walk through hospitals where Moxi is deployed, it's the first robot
that many people have encountered," she added. "Patients are getting used to
seeing a future with robots."

"Achieving full autonomy to enable hospital-wide transport tasks is just
scratching the surface of what humanoid robots like Moxi will do in hospitals
and beyond," said Thomaz. "The knowledge and trust that we gain from
healthcare settings will inform future product developments. We look forward
to building humanoid social robots to collaborate and assist with caring for
people in many different settings."
