summary: 'If you've just picked up the new iPad mini, or any iPad for that matter, you're probably already loving its versatility. But the right accessories can take your tablet experience to a whole new level. From productivity boosts to style upgrades, accessories are essential for getting the most out of your iPad. For instance, a keyboard folio can transform your iPad into a mini laptop, perfect for typing on the go, while a folio case provides protection with a touch of style.There are also accessories like power adapters for quicker charging or hubs with a dual USB-C port to connect multiple devices at once, which can be game-changers if you're working with more than one gadget. And as iPadOS keeps evolving, so do the ways we can make our iPads feel more like complete workstations or creative hubs. Whether you’re after a high-quality screen protector, a new stand or anything in between, there are accessories for everyone that can make your iPad even more capable and fun to use.
Which iPad generation do you own?
Before you splurge on a bunch of accessories, you should double check which iPad generation you own. There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number. 
The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the 9th-gen iPad that still uses a Lightning connector (and is on the way out anyway). Make sure to double check your iPad’s screen size before buying a folio case or a screen protector. As for the Apple Pencil, check out this guide to how to choose the right Apple Pencil to make sure you're getting the right one for the tablet you have.
Best iPad accessories for 2024
























Paper-feel iPad screen protectors
If you’re a heavy user of the Apple Pencil or some other stylus, you should consider getting a screen protector for your new iPad. They pull double-duty: Not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.
