summary: 'The final piece of Apple’s recent explosion of Mac hardware, the iMac is ready for review — and possible purchase — and it looks the same as ever.
One quiet update that transforms the lineup, beyond the powerful M4 chip, is the boost in base memory, finally giving the entry-level models 16GB instead of the miserly 8GB they used to get. With an unchanged design, there might seem to be no justification to buy or upgrade to the iMac M4. However, that extra memory allows you to do more than ever on an entry-level iMac, including 4K video editing and AAA gaming — to a degree. Having said that, upgrades remain expensive beyond the base loadout, which is already $1,299.
