Text-to-SQL generation aims to translate natural language questions into SQL statements. In large language models (LLMs) based Text-to-SQL, schema linking is a widely adopted strategy to streamline the input for LLMs by selecting only relevant schema elements, therefore reducing noise and computational overhead. However, schema linking faces risks that requires caution, including the potential omission of necessary elements and disruption of database structural integrity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called RSL-SQL that combines bidirectional schema linking, contextual information augmentation, binary selection strategy, and multi-turn self-correction. Our approach improves the recall of schema linking through forward and backward pruning and hedges the risk by voting between full schema and contextual information augmented simplified schema. Experiments on the BIRD and Spider benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy among open-source solutions, with 67.2% on BIRD and 87.9% on Spider using GPT-4o. Furthermore, our approach outperforms a series of GPT-4 based Text-to-SQL systems when adopting DeepSeek (much cheaper) with same intact prompts. Extensive analysis and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in our framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Laqcce-cao/RSL-SQL.
