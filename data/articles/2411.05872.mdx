Developing robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Arabic, a language characterized by its rich dialectal diversity and often considered a low-resource language in speech technology, demands effective strategies to manage its complexity. This study explores three critical factors influencing ASR performance: the role of dialectal coverage in pre-training, the effectiveness of dialect-specific fine-tuning compared to a multi-dialectal approach, and the ability to generalize to unseen dialects. Through extensive experiments across different dialect combinations, our findings offer key insights towards advancing the development of ASR systems for pluricentric languages like Arabic.
