Despite recent progress in reducing road fatalities, the persistently high
rate of traffic-related deaths highlights the necessity for improved safety
interventions. Leveraging large-scale graph-based nationwide road network data
across 49 states in the USA, our study first posits the Concurrency Hypothesis
from intuitive observations, suggesting a significant likelihood of incidents
occurring at neighboring nodes within the road network. To quantify this
phenomenon, we introduce two novel metrics, Average Neighbor Crash Density
(ANCD) and Average Neighbor Crash Continuity (ANCC), and subsequently employ
them in statistical tests to validate the hypothesis rigorously. Building upon
this foundation, we propose the Concurrency Prior (CP) method, a powerful
approach designed to enhance the predictive capabilities of general Graph
Neural Network (GNN) models in semi-supervised traffic incident prediction
tasks. Our method allows GNNs to incorporate concurrent incident information,
as mentioned in the hypothesis, via tokenization with negligible extra
parameters.
  The extensive experiments, utilizing real-world data across states and cities
in the USA, demonstrate that integrating CP into 12 state-of-the-art GNN
architectures leads to significant improvements, with gains ranging from 3% to
13% in F1 score and 1.3% to 9% in AUC metrics. The code is publicly available
