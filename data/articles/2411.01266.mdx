Recent methods in quantile regression have adopted a classification
perspective to handle challenges posed by heteroscedastic, multimodal, or
skewed data by quantizing outputs into fixed bins. Although these
regression-as-classification frameworks can capture high-density prediction
regions and bypass convex quantile constraints, they are restricted by
quantization errors and the curse of dimensionality due to a constant number of
bins per dimension. To address these limitations, we introduce a conformalized
high-density quantile regression approach with a dynamically adaptive set of
prototypes. Our method optimizes the set of prototypes by adaptively adding,
deleting, and relocating quantization bins throughout the training process.
Moreover, our conformal scheme provides valid coverage guarantees, focusing on
regions with the highest probability density. Experiments across diverse
datasets and dimensionalities confirm that our method consistently achieves
high-quality prediction regions with enhanced coverage and robustness, all
while utilizing fewer prototypes and memory, ensuring scalability to higher
dimensions. The code is available at https://github.com/batuceng/max_quantile .
