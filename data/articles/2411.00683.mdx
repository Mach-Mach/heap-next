We present TaxaBind, a unified embedding space for characterizing any species
of interest. TaxaBind is a multimodal embedding space across six modalities:
ground-level images of species, geographic location, satellite image, text,
audio, and environmental features, useful for solving ecological problems. To
learn this joint embedding space, we leverage ground-level images of species as
a binding modality. We propose multimodal patching, a technique for effectively
distilling the knowledge from various modalities into the binding modality. We
construct two large datasets for pretraining: iSatNat with species images and
satellite images, and iSoundNat with species images and audio. Additionally, we
introduce TaxaBench-8k, a diverse multimodal dataset with six paired modalities
for evaluating deep learning models on ecological tasks. Experiments with
TaxaBind demonstrate its strong zero-shot and emergent capabilities on a range
of tasks including species classification, cross-model retrieval, and audio
classification. The datasets and models are made available at
