Whole-slide images (WSI) glomerulus segmentation is essential for accurately diagnosing kidney diseases. In this work, we propose a practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/huuquan1994/wsi_glomerulus_seg.
