Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich
emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a
research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the
causes of emotions typically uses clause selection methods to locate the reason
utterance, without providing a detailed explanation of the emotional causes. In
this paper, we propose a new task, \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{C}onversation
\textbf{E}motion \textbf{C}ause \textbf{E}xplanation (MCECE), aiming to
generate a detailed explanation of the emotional cause to the target utterance
within a multimodal conversation scenario. Building upon the MELD dataset, we
develop a new dataset (ECEM) that integrates video clips with detailed
explanations of character emotions, facilitating an in-depth examination of the
causal factors behind emotional expressions in multimodal conversations.A novel
approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the
emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the
contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the
emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental
results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net significantly
outperforms several excellent large language model baselines. Code and dataset
