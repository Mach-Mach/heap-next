Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses distribution shifts during testing by
adapting a pretrained model without access to source data. In this work, we
propose a novel TTA approach for 3D point cloud classification, combining
sampling variation with weight averaging. Our method leverages Farthest Point
Sampling (FPS) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to create multiple point cloud
representations, adapting the model for each variation using the TENT
algorithm. The final model parameters are obtained by averaging the adapted
weights, leading to improved robustness against distribution shifts. Extensive
experiments on ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C datasets, with
different backbones (Point-MAE, PointNet, DGCNN), demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining minimal resource
overhead. The proposed method effectively enhances model generalization and
stability in challenging real-world conditions.
