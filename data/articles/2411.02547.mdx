In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for probabilistically updating
and rasterizing semantic maps within 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). Although
previous methods have introduced algorithms which learn to rasterize features
in 3D-GS for enhanced scene understanding, 3D-GS can fail without warning which
presents a challenge for safety-critical robotic applications. To address this
gap, we propose a method which advances the literature of continuous semantic
mapping from voxels to ellipsoids, combining the precise structure of 3D-GS
with the ability to quantify uncertainty of probabilistic robotic maps. Given a
set of images, our algorithm performs a probabilistic semantic update directly
on the 3D ellipsoids to obtain an expectation and variance through the use of
conjugate priors. We also propose a probabilistic rasterization which returns
per-pixel segmentation predictions with quantifiable uncertainty. We compare
our method with similar probabilistic voxel-based methods to verify our
extension to 3D ellipsoids, and perform ablation studies on uncertainty
quantification and temporal smoothing.
