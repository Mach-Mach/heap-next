As demands for communication and computational capabilities escalate,
traditional bit-oriented communication falls short of these stringent
requirements, especially for mission-critical and computation-intensive
applications. Visual Question Answering (VQA), a representative application,
has adopted edge computing to mitigate local computational constraints and
accelerate visual perception with natural language. However, it encounters
significant communication challenges such as limited bandwidth, reduced
transmission power, and increased noise levels, leading to considerable latency
and reduced efficiency in image and question transmission. we propose a
goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework that focuses on
effectively extracting and transmitting semantic information most relevant to
the VQA goals, improving the answering accuracy and enhancing the effectiveness
and efficiency. The objective is to maximize the answering accuracy, and we
propose a scene graphs (SG)-based image semantic extraction and ranking
approach to prioritize the semantic information based on the goal of questions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our GSC framework improves answering
accuracy by up to 59% under Rayleigh channels while reducing total latency by
up to 65% compared to traditional bit-oriented transmission.
