Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.
