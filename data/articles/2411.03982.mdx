Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion models have revolutionized image editing
by enabling the generation of high-quality photorealistic images. While the de
facto method for performing edits with T2I models is through text instructions,
this approach non-trivial due to the complex many-to-many mapping between
natural language and images. In this work, we address exemplar-based image
editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an exemplar pair to a content
image(s). We propose ReEdit, a modular and efficient end-to-end framework that
captures edits in both text and image modalities while ensuring the fidelity of
the edited image. We validate the effectiveness of ReEdit through extensive
comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines and sensitivity analyses of key
design choices. Our results demonstrate that ReEdit consistently outperforms
contemporary approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally,
ReEdit boasts high practical applicability, as it does not require any
task-specific optimization and is four times faster than the next best
baseline.
