Color-word associations play a fundamental role in human cognition and design
applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely available and
demonstrated intelligent behaviors in various benchmarks with natural
conversation skills. However, their ability to replicate human color-word
associations remains understudied. We compared multiple generations of LLMs
(from GPT-3 to GPT-4o) against human color-word associations using data
collected from over 10,000 Japanese participants, involving 17 colors and words
from eight categories in Japanese. Our findings reveal a clear progression in
LLM performance across generations, with GPT-4o achieving the highest accuracy
in predicting the best voted word for each color and category. However, the
highest median performance was approximately 50% even for GPT-4o with visual
inputs (chance level is 10%), and the performance levels varied significantly
across word categories and colors, indicating a failure to fully replicate
human color-word associations. On the other hand, color discrimination ability
estimated from our color-word association data showed that LLMs demonstrated
high correlation with human color discrimination patterns, similarly to
previous studies. Our study highlights both the advancements in LLM
capabilities and their persistent limitations, suggesting differences in
semantic memory structures between humans and LLMs in representing color-word
associations.
