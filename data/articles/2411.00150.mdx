Zero-shot domain adaptation for dialogue state tracking (DST) remains a
challenging problem in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, where models must
generalize to target domains unseen at training time. Current large language
model approaches for zero-shot domain adaptation rely on prompting to introduce
knowledge pertaining to the target domains. However, their efficacy strongly
depends on prompt engineering, as well as the zero-shot ability of the
underlying language model. In this work, we devise a novel data augmentation
approach, Schema Augmentation, that improves the zero-shot domain adaptation of
language models through fine-tuning. Schema Augmentation is a simple but
effective technique that enhances generalization by introducing variations of
slot names within the schema provided in the prompt. Experiments on MultiWOZ
and SpokenWOZ showed that the proposed approach resulted in a substantial
improvement over the baseline, in some experiments achieving over a twofold
accuracy gain over unseen domains while maintaining equal or superior
performance over all domains.
