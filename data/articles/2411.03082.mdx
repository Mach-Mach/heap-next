This paper shows how an uncertainty-aware, deep neural network can be trained
to detect, recognise and localise objects in 2D RGB images, in applications
lacking annotated train-ng datasets. We propose a self-supervising
teacher-student pipeline, in which a relatively simple teacher classifier,
trained with only a few labelled 2D thumbnails, automatically processes a
larger body of unlabelled RGB-D data to teach a student network based on a
modified YOLOv3 architecture. Firstly, 3D object detection with back projection
is used to automatically extract and teach 2D detection and localisation
information to the student network. Secondly, a weakly supervised 2D thumbnail
classifier, with minimal training on a small number of hand-labelled images, is
used to teach object category recognition. Thirdly, we use a Gaussian Process
GP to encode and teach a robust uncertainty estimation functionality, so that
the student can output confidence scores with each categorization. The
resulting student significantly outperforms the same YOLO architecture trained
directly on the same amount of labelled data. Our GP-based approach yields
robust and meaningful uncertainty estimations for complex industrial object
classifications. The end-to-end network is also capable of real-time
processing, needed for robotics applications. Our method can be applied to many
important industrial tasks, where labelled datasets are typically unavailable.
In this paper, we demonstrate an example of detection, localisation, and object
category recognition of nuclear mixed-waste materials in highly cluttered and
unstructured scenes. This is critical for robotic sorting and handling of
legacy nuclear waste, which poses complex environmental remediation challenges
in many nuclearised nations.
