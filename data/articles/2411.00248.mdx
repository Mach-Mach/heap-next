Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a multi-faceted process that requires
clinicians to assess complex multi-modal patient data patient, often
collaboratively. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to streamline this
process by synthesizing vast medical knowledge and multi-modal health data.
However, single-agent are often ill-suited for nuanced medical contexts
requiring adaptable, collaborative problem-solving. Our MDAgents addresses this
need by dynamically assigning collaboration structures to LLMs based on task
complexity, mimicking real-world clinical collaboration and decision-making.
This framework improves diagnostic accuracy and supports adaptive responses in
complex, real-world medical scenarios, making it a valuable tool for clinicians
in various healthcare settings, and at the same time, being more efficient in
terms of computing cost than static multi-agent decision making methods.
